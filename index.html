    <p>Hermione Jean Granger (b. 19 September, 1979) is a fictional character in J.K.Rowling's 
    <cite>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter">Harry Potter</a></cite> 
    	series. She was a Muggle-born witch and the daughter 
        of Mr and Mrs Granger, both dentists in London. Hermione grew up as a normal Muggle 
        girl until, at age eleven, she learned that she was a witch and had been accepted 
        intoHogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. She began attending the school on 
        1 September, 1991, where she was subsequently Sorted into Gryffindor House, despite 
        having the intelligence to be inRavenclaw. She possessed a brilliant academic mind, 
        and proved to be a gifted student. She was very studious and bookish.
        Hermione first met Harry Potter and Ron Weasley aboard theHogwarts Express. Both boys found 
        Hermione unfriendly and somewhat of an insufferable know-it-all. Later her eagerness to please 
        her professors and her constantly correct answers reinforced their initial impression. However,
        in spite of the cool relationship between the three, Hermione stepped in to take the blame 
        from Ron and Harry after they had saved her from a troll on Hallowe'en in 1991. Harry and 
        Ron were surprised, but grateful and the three quickly became friends. In her second year, 
        Hermione played a crucial role in the discovery of the Chamber of Secrets before falling victim 
        to the basilisk unleashed upon Hogwarts following the opening of the Chamber. She was recovered 
        from her petrification under the care of Madam Pomfrey with the assistance of Professor Sprout's 
        Mandrake Restorative Draught. The following year, Hermione was granted permission to use, and was 
        sent, a Time-Turner from the Ministry of Magic to facilitate her volition to study far more subjects
        than was possible without time travel. Later in the year, she and Harry would use the Time-Turner 
        to rescue Sirius Black from the Dementor's Kiss as well as Buckbeak the hippogrifffrom execution. 
        During her fourth year at Hogwarts, Hermione became an advocate for the better treatment of 
        house-elves, forming the association S.P.E.W. She also helped Harry prepare for the Triwizard 
        Tournament. In her fifth year, she was the driving force behind the creation of Dumbledore's 
        Army. Later in her fifth year, she fought alongside Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Ginny Weasley, 
        Luna Lovegood, and Neville Longbottom in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. In her sixth 
        year, she fought in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower and, at the beginning of what would have 
        been her seventh year, the Battle of the Seven Potters in 1997.
